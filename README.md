ChessScripts contains the main solution (Python). It also contains the StockFish engine and selected Gaviota and Syzygy tablebases.

MyChessGUI contains my chess program which implements a graphical user interface and a move generator. If you do not wish to compile the program, you can use the Compiled.zip file. Current configuration uses the external move generator which is provided by StockFish. Internal move generator can be enabled in Chessboard.cs file.
